# The Quasi-Periodic Flight Guidance System

To build and start the simulation, type the following commands:

```
make
./fgs.byte
```

This will launch a simulation of the flight guidance system running on
a two-node quasi-periodic architecture.

Explore the ZÃ©lus code (file fgs.zls) to see the details of the model.
